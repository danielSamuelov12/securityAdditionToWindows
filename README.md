It seems like you're describing a security system that involves face recognition and capturing images of users when they log into an account, with the images stored securely in an encrypted folder. The system aims to add an additional layer of security beyond the traditional password protection. You're also suggesting that the application should be automatically launched at startup by adding a VBS file to the startup folder.

Here's a potential README file for your GitHub project:

# Advanced Security System with Face ID and User Image Capture

## Overview
This security system adds an extra layer of protection to your computer by capturing an image of the user whenever they log into their account. The system works alongside the existing password security and uses Face ID technology to authenticate users. If someone tries to log into the account, the system takes a photo and saves it in an encrypted folder for future reference. This can help identify who accessed your account.

## Features
- **Face Recognition**: Uses Face ID to authenticate users.
- **Image Capture**: Automatically takes a picture of the user during login attempts.
- **Encrypted Image Storage**: The captured image is stored in a secure, encrypted folder to protect privacy.
- **Automatic Startup**: The security system starts automatically when the computer is turned on.

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the zip file.
2. Ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed, such as Face ID authentication software.
3. Add the `securitySystem.vbs` file to the `shell:startup` folder to ensure the system runs automatically on startup. You can do this by:
   - Press `Win + R` and type `shell:startup`, then press Enter.
   - Place the `securitySystem.vbs` file in the folder that opens.
4. Modify the system settings to meet your specific requirements (such as face recognition setup).

## Usage
- Once the system is installed and running, it will prompt you for Face ID authentication upon login.
- If a login attempt is successful, the system captures an image of the user and stores it in an encrypted folder.
- You can view the captured images by decrypting the folder with the appropriate password or key.

## Security Notes
- Ensure that your Face ID and image storage are configured securely.
- Only authorized personnel should have access to the encrypted photo folder.
